                          I work for the Environment Agency.  As part of our role to protect and improve the environment, we (the Environment Agency) need to monitor the health of our rivers and streams. We are setting up a new network of randomly selected monitoring sites, known as the River Surveillance Network (RSN).  I am writing to you because we need access to a site via your land, to assess its suitability for inclusion in this network. Full details of the RSN can be found in the enclosed handout.
                          
                          We would like to visit the site shown on the map overleaf by a [colour] dot.  We will assess parking, access and potential sampling locations, to see if they are suitable for the RSN.  The site visits are planned between June and October 2021.  Staff visiting the site will be carrying identification. If the site is suitable, monitoring would be undertaken [describe monitoring pattern for that site based on panel assignment if known] starting in January 2023. Each year that the site is actively monitored we will need to visit the sites every month to take water quality samples, twice a year in spring and autumn to look at the invertebrates and algae, and once in the summer to look at the plants and habitat.  All monitoring would be undertaken within a 500 m reach up or downstream from the point identified.
                          
                          If you would like to discuss any aspect of the RSN network please contact me by phone or email shown below.  Please also contact me if you have any reason why we would be unable to do a site visit or select the site for the RSN. If we do not hear from you, we will assume that the site assessment can go ahead and will be in touch at a later date if it is suitable for inclusion in the network.
